context: |
  File: app/src/main/java/com/dn0ne/player/PlaybackService.kt

instructions: |
  - Add try-catch blocks around media operations in PlaybackService.kt
  - Create a NotificationHelper class for user-friendly error messages
  - Handle specific exceptions: IOException, SecurityException, IllegalArgumentException
  - Implement retry mechanism for temporary failures
  - Add logging for debugging purposes
  - Create unit tests for error scenarios in `app/src/test/java/com/dn0ne/player/PlaybackServiceTest.kt`
  - Ensure error handling doesn't break the MediaSession lifecycle
