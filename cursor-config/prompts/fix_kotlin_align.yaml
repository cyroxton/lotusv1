description: "Correct the Kotlin compilation error related to Modifier.align in PlayerScreen.kt and ensure the build succeeds."
context: |
  Project: Lotus music player for Android
  - Main file: app/src/main/java/com/dn0ne/player/app/presentation/PlayerScreen.kt
  - UI framework: Jetpack Compose
  - Gradle version: 8.11.1
  - Issue to fix:
    - Compilation error at PlayerScreen.kt:1116:42: 'fun Modifier.align(alignment: Alignment): Modifier' cannot be called with an implicit receiver.
instructions: |
  - In app/src/main/java/com/dn0ne/player/app/presentation/PlayerScreen.kt:
    1. Open the file and go to line 1116.
    2. Fix the syntax error by ensuring Modifier.align is called with an explicit receiver (e.g., replace align(Alignment.Center) with Modifier.align(Alignment.Center)).
    3. Verify the surrounding code to ensure compatibility with Jetpack Compose (e.g., check if it's within a Box, Column, or Row scope).
    4. Suggest a correction if the context requires adjusting the composable structure.
  - Run ./gradlew build to verify the fix.
  - Generate a report in REPORT_KOTLIN_FIXES.md summarizing the changes and build status.
  - Ensure compatibility with Jetpack Compose and Gradle 8.11.1.
